# Introducing-Python
My work throught the book Introducing Python by Bill Lubanovic (O'Reilly). Copyright 2015 Bill Lubanovic, 978-1-449-35936-2

These will be the code shown in the book, I will make another repository for the actual p-set's.

This work is not mine!! I just want practice with GitHub!
